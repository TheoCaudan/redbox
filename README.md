# Red Box - Offensive Security Operations

**⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠️**

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)

This repository contains the offensive security components and tools for our cybersecurity lab environment. The Red Box serves as our attack platform for simulating adversarial techniques and validating our defensive capabilities.

## Overview

The Red Box is designed to:
- Simulate realistic attack scenarios and techniques
- Test the effectiveness of defensive controls
- Provide a controlled environment for offensive security training
- Develop and validate custom attack payloads

## Current Status

This repository is currently under active development. Core offensive tools are being implemented and configured. Attack scenarios and automation are in early development stages with significant enhancements planned.

## Key Components

- **Sliver C2 Framework**: Command and control infrastructure
- **Custom Payloads**: Windows and Linux attack scripts
- **Attack Automation**: Scripted attack sequences
- **Cleanup Tools**: Post-exercise environment restoration

## Getting Started

**Note**: Setup instructions will be expanded in future updates.

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the initial setup script: `./scripts/setup-redbox.sh`
3. Follow the prompts to configure the offensive environment

## Security Notice

This environment is designed for authorized security testing within a controlled lab setting. The tools and techniques contained within should never be used against unauthorized targets or production systems.

## Future Enhancements

- Additional attack vectors and techniques
- Advanced evasion capabilities
- Automated multi-stage attack scenarios
- Enhanced reporting of findings
- Integration with MITRE ATT&CK framework

## Network Information

The Red Box operates on the isolated attack network (`192.168.12.0/24`) with strictly controlled access to the Blue network (`192.168.11.0/24`) for authorized testing scenarios only.

## About This Project

This is a personal portfolio project I developed on my own to showcase my skills in offensive security operations, penetration testing, and red team tactics. Feel free to use, modify, and learn from this project for your own educational purposes.

The project demonstrates my understanding of attack methodologies, command and control frameworks, and ethical hacking techniques in a controlled environment.

## Ethical Use Statement

This project is intended solely for educational purposes and to demonstrate technical skills in a portfolio context. Always practice ethical hacking and never use these techniques against systems without explicit permission.
